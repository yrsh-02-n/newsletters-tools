# Newsletters Tools App
This application provides a set of tools designed to streamline email marketing campaign preparation.

Currently, only the WhatsApp link generator with preset messages is available.

# WhatsApp Link Generator
Users can:
- Choose one of two templates (both related to real estate)
- Or enter a custom message manually
- Then input the phone number
- Generate a link that opens WhatsApp with the pre-filled message

This is particularly useful when your email campaign includes a button linking to a WhatsApp consultant with a predefined consultation topic.
The app stores the last 5 generated links in localStorage.

# Google Calendar Event Generator
A tool for creating Google Calendar events. A more detailed description will appear once the generator becomes available.

# Main Goals
The purpose of creating this application was to combine:
- Valuable programming practice
- Developing tools useful for my work (and may be for yours too)

The functionality will likely expand as my skills grow and new work needs emerge.
