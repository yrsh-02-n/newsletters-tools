# Newsletters Tools App
This application provides a set of tools designed to streamline email marketing campaign preparation.

Currently, only the WhatsApp link generator with preset messages is available.

# WhatsApp Link Generator
Users can:
- Choose one of two templates (both related to real estate)
- Or enter a custom message manually
- Then input the phone number
- Generate a link that opens WhatsApp with the pre-filled message

This is particularly useful when your email campaign includes a button linking to a WhatsApp consultant with a predefined consultation topic.
The app stores the last 5 generated links in localStorage.

# Google Calendar Event Generator
A tool for creating Google Calendar events.
- Select start and end date/time for the event
- Enter name of event
- Optionally add description, location, and timezone
- Generate a ready-to-use Google Calendar event link based on your inputs

# Main Goals
The purpose of creating this application was to combine:
